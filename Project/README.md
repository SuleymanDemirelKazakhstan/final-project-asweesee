Main risks in E-Learning involve inelegant people masquerading as Students and writing testson behalf of enrolled Students.
Designing, developing, and delivering E-Learning products requires a quality of hardware components such as high ended web server & database server ,high bandwidth internet leased line , along with a robust infrastructure capable of sustaining multiple users and networked applications.
Confidentiality violation : An unauthorized party gaining access of the assets present in E-Learning system.
Denial of Service : Prevention of legitimate access rights by disrupting traffic during the transaction among the users of E-Learning system. 

System team should suggest the remedies of these risks properly otherwise total project cost will be
 almost double. We presented the risks that may occur by different participants of E-Learning and its counter 
measure tools/ techniques to minimize those risks.
