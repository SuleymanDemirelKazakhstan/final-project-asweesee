<h3>Week 3</h3>
In weekly meetings with our team we discussed about: How the project is to be implemented?
What are various constraints(time costs and staff)? 
What is market strategy?
We specified our roles and goals.
We writed user stories on Notion.so.



<h3>Week 4</h3>
We worked with sitemap which does not coincides with our preferences and we made it again.
We made simple list of major pages of our site and elements which will be in them.
We sketched first wireframes of  what will be seen on Administration module, lecturer mofule, and student module.
We also discussed about site responsiveness. It is not required but it takes to much work on it.
And assumed about future risks
